# libstellar

A personal Scala library for my Fabric mods. Mainly provides interfaces and abstract classes for reducing boilerplate. 

Depends on [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric), [owo-lib](https://github.com/wisp-forest/owo-lib), [CICADA](https://github.com/enjarai/cicada-lib), and [Scalable Cat's Force](https://github.com/Kotori316/SLP-fabric).
