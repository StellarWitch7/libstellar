# libstellar

A personal Kotlin library for my Fabric mods. Mainly provides interfaces and abstract classes for reducing boilerplate. 

Depends on [owo-lib](https://github.com/wisp-forest/owo-lib), [CICADA](https://github.com/enjarai/cicada-lib), and [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-language-kotlin/).
